## This Project
This repository contains my personal website, which features my social platforms, a little info about me, and sections to show my blog posts and projects.

## Technology Stack
This website is built using ReactJS & Bootstrap.

## Blog System
The blog system is a couple of dynamic components that reach out to a microservice to fetch data and display blog post previews/content. You can find the microservice that is being used here: https://github.com/Sdyess/blog-microservice

## Deployment
To run the website locally, you can just use yarn start

To build the website and deploy to production, you can use yarn build.
